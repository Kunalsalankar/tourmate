# Quick Fix: Notification Scheduler is Null

## 🔴 Problem
You're seeing this error:
```
⚠️ Notification scheduler is null!
```

## ✅ Solution

The issue is that you're using **hot reload** instead of **full restart**. The `main()` function doesn't re-run on hot reload, so the old version of the app (without the scheduler) is still running.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Stop the app completely** (press the stop button in your IDE)

2. **Run the app again** (full restart):
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   OR press `Ctrl+F5` in VS Code / Android Studio

3. **Look for these logs on startup:**
   ```
   🔧 [MAIN] Notification scheduler created: true
   🔧 [MAIN] Starting app with scheduler...
   🏗️ [APP] Building MyApp...
      Scheduler received: true
   🏗️ [APP] Creating TripCubit with scheduler: true
   ```

4. **Now create a future trip** and you should see:
   ```
   🚀 [TRIP_CUBIT] Creating trip...
      📲 Scheduling notifications for future trip...
   🔔 [SCHEDULER] scheduleNotificationsForTrip called
   📅 [NOTIFICATION] Attempting to schedule trip notification
      ✅ Trip notification scheduled successfully!
   ```

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

After full restart:

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] You see "Scheduler received: true" in logs
- [ ] Create a **Future** trip (time = current time + 3 minutes)
- [ ] Check logs show "✅ Trip notification scheduled successfully!"
- [ ] Wait 3 minutes
- [ ] Notification appears on your device

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Always do FULL RESTART** when you change `main.dart`
2. **Hot reload** doesn't work for changes in `main()` function
3. Make sure trip type is **"Future"** (not Active or Past)
4. Set trip time to **at least 2-3 minutes in the future**

**Note:** The reminder will be skipped for trips less than 1 hour away. This is normal!

## 🛠️ If Still Not Working

1. **Check you did FULL RESTART** (not hot reload)
2. **Check logs show scheduler is not null**
3. **Verify trip type is "Future"**
4. **Verify trip time is in the future**
5. **Check notification permissions are granted**

## ✅ Success Indicator

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ No "scheduler is null" error
- ✅ Logs show "Trip notification scheduled successfully!"
- ✅ Notification appears at the scheduled time
