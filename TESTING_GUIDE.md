## üì± Real Device Testing Required

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Automatic trip detection requires GPS sensors and cannot be fully tested on:
- Windows Desktop
- Web browsers
- Emulators without GPS simulation

**You MUST test on a real Android or iOS device.**

flutter pub get
flutter run
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Detection not starting

**Check:**

3. Check logs for errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check permissions
adb shell dumpsys package com.example.tourmate | grep permission

# Restart app
flutter run
```

---

### Issue: Trip not detected

**Check:**
1. Did you move for 3+ minutes?
2. Was distance > 300 meters?
3. Was speed > 2 m/s?

**Debug:**
- Check logs for speed values
- Reduce thresholds temporarily for testing

---

### Issue: Wrong mode detected
