# Real-Time Trip Notification Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

This document describes the complete implementation of real-time notifications for future trips with first-launch permission requests.

---

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. **First-Launch Notification Permission Request**
- ‚úÖ Users are prompted to enable notifications when they open the app for the first time
- ‚úÖ Beautiful dialog explaining why notifications are needed
- ‚úÖ Permission request happens only once (tracked via SharedPreferences)
- ‚úÖ Users can choose "Not Now" or "Enable"

### 2. **Automatic Trip Notifications**
- ‚úÖ When a user creates a **future trip**, notifications are automatically scheduled
- ‚úÖ **Two notifications** are sent:
  - **1 hour before trip starts**: Reminder notification
  - **At trip start time**: "Trip Starting Now!" notification
- ‚úÖ Notifications include trip details (origin ‚Üí destination)
- ‚úÖ Works even when the app is closed (background notifications)

### 3. **Smart Notification Management**
- ‚úÖ Notifications are automatically **rescheduled** when a trip is updated
- ‚úÖ Notifications are **cancelled** when a trip is deleted
- ‚úÖ Only **future trips** get notifications (not active or past trips)
- ‚úÖ Notifications respect device timezone

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`lib/core/services/preferences_service.dart`**
   - Manages app preferences using SharedPreferences
   - Tracks first launch and permission request status

### Modified Files:
1. **`lib/core/services/notification_service.dart`**
   - Added Android 13+ permission handling using `permission_handler`
   - Added `arePermissionsGranted()` method
   - Enhanced `requestPermissions()` for both Android and iOS

2. **`lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`**
   - Added first-launch detection
   - Added permission request dialog
   - Shows user-friendly explanation for notifications

3. **`lib/main.dart`**
   - Removed automatic permission request (moved to splash screen)

4. **`pubspec.yaml`**
   - Added `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` dependency

### Existing Files (Already Implemented):
- `lib/core/services/trip_notification_scheduler.dart` - Manages notification scheduling
- `lib/cubit/trip_cubit.dart` - Integrates notifications with trip CRUD operations
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Contains required permissions

---

## üîß How It Works

### First Launch Flow:
```
1. User opens app for first time
2. Splash screen animation plays (2 seconds)
3. PreferencesService checks if permission was requested before
4. If not requested ‚Üí Show permission dialog
5. User clicks "Enable" ‚Üí Request notification permissions
6. Permission status saved ‚Üí Never ask again
7. Navigate to Sign In or Home screen
```

### Creating a Future Trip:
```
1. User creates a trip with future date/time
2. Trip is saved to Firestore
3. TripCubit calls TripNotificationScheduler
4. Two notifications are scheduled:
   - Reminder: 1 hour before trip start
   - Start: At exact trip start time
5. Notifications stored locally on device
```

### When Trip Time Arrives:
```
1. Device triggers scheduled notification (even if app is closed)
2. User sees: "Trip Starting Now! üöÄ"
3. Notification shows: "Your trip from [Origin] to [Destination] is starting now"
4. User can tap notification to open app
```

## üîê Permissions Required

### Android (Already in AndroidManifest.xml):
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
```

### iOS:
- Permissions requested automatically via `IOSFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin`

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

All required dependencies are already in `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
flutter_local_notifications: ^15.1.1  # Local notifications
timezone: ^0.9.2                       # Timezone support
permission_handler: ^11.3.0            # Android 13+ permissions
shared_preferences: ^2.2.2             # First-launch tracking
```

---

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test First-Launch Permission Request:
1. **Clear app data** (or uninstall and reinstall)
2. Open the app
3. After splash screen, you should see the permission dialog
4. Click "Enable" ‚Üí Permission should be granted
5. Close and reopen app ‚Üí Dialog should NOT appear again

### Test Trip Notifications:
1. **Create a future trip**:
   - Set start time to **3 minutes from now**
   - Fill in origin and destination
   - Save the trip

2. **Wait for notifications**:
   - At **2 minutes from now**: You should receive "Upcoming Trip Reminder ‚è∞"
   - At **3 minutes from now**: You should receive "Trip Starting Now! üöÄ"

3. **Verify notification content**:
   - Check that origin and destination are correct
   - Tap notification to ensure app opens

### Test Update/Delete:
1. **Update a future trip**: Change the time ‚Üí Old notifications cancelled, new ones scheduled
2. **Delete a future trip**: All notifications for that trip should be cancelled

---

## üé® Permission Dialog UI

The permission request dialog includes:
- **Icon**: Notification bell icon in primary color
- **Title**: "Enable Notifications"
- **Message**: User-friendly explanation of why notifications are needed
- **Buttons**:
  - "Not Now" (TextButton) - User can skip
  - "Enable" (ElevatedButton) - Requests permissions
- **Success Feedback**: Green snackbar when enabled

---

## üîç Debugging

### Check if permissions are granted:
```dart
final notificationService = NotificationService();
final granted = await notificationService.arePermissionsGranted();
print('Notifications enabled: $granted');
```

### View pending notifications:
```dart
final scheduler = TripNotificationScheduler(
  notificationService: NotificationService()
);
await scheduler.getPendingNotifications();
// Prints all scheduled notifications to console
```

### Reset first-launch flag (for testing):
```dart
final prefsService = PreferencesService();
await prefsService.initialize();
await prefsService.reset(); // Clears all preferences
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options

### Change Reminder Time:
Edit `trip_notification_scheduler.dart`:
```dart
await _notificationService.scheduleTripReminderNotification(
  trip,
  reminderBefore: Duration(hours: 2), // Change from 1 to 2 hours
);
```

### Disable Reminder Notifications:
In `trip_cubit.dart`, change:
```dart
await _notificationScheduler!.scheduleNotificationsForTrip(
  createdTrip,
  includeReminder: false, // Set to false
);
```

### Customize Notification Messages:
Edit `notification_service.dart`:
- Line 195-196: Trip start notification text
- Line 252-253: Reminder notification text

### Customize Permission Dialog:
Edit `splash_screen.dart` ‚Üí `_requestNotificationPermissions()` method

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Notifications not appearing?
1. ‚úÖ Check permissions are granted
2. ‚úÖ Verify trip is marked as `TripType.future`
3. ‚úÖ Ensure trip time is in the future
4. ‚úÖ Check device battery optimization settings
5. ‚úÖ Verify Android version (Android 13+ requires explicit permission)

### Permission dialog not showing?
1. Clear app data or uninstall/reinstall
2. Check `PreferencesService` is initialized
3. Verify `hasRequestedNotificationPermission` returns `false`

### Notifications at wrong time?
1. Check device timezone settings
2. Verify trip time is saved correctly in Firestore
3. Check timezone initialization in `main.dart`

## üì± Platform-Specific Notes

### Android:
- **Android 13+ (API 33+)**: Requires explicit runtime permission
- **Android 12 and below**: Notifications work automatically
- **Exact alarms**: Uses `exactAllowWhileIdle` to work in Doze mode
- **Boot completed**: Notifications persist after device restart

### iOS:
- Permissions requested via native iOS dialog
- User can manage permissions in Settings app
- Notifications work in background and foreground
